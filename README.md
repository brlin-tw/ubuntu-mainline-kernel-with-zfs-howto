# How to build the ZFS kernel module against a Ubuntu mainline kernel

Documents the process of building a recent version ZFS kernel module against a Ubuntu mainline kernel version, and the details on how to make it work properly in runtime.

## The problem

The AMDGPU driver shipped in the Ubuntu 24.04 kernel contains a issue that may cause system instability after some videos are played on a Framework Laptop 13(AMD 7040 series) system.  I would like to install a recent [mainline kernel](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/mainline/) built by Ubuntu to check whether the issue can still be reproduced, however it failed to boot due to the missing ZFS driver which is used as the storage system in my system.  Installing the `zfs-dkms` package doesn't work either as it isn't compatible with newer kernel versions.

## The solution

I would like to build the recent version ZFS kernel against the mainline kernel version to allow the system to boot without rebuilding the entire Linux kernel.

## Acquire the project release archive

This project provides a working directory with auxiliary files(referenced later as "the project working directory") to help you work with the tutorial.  Download the ubuntu-mainline-kernel-with-zfs-howto-_X_._Y_._Z_.tar.gz release package from [the Releases page](https://gitlab.com/brlin/ubuntu-mainline-kernel-with-zfs-howto/-/releases).

## Launch a text terminal

The following operations are necessary or recommended to be done in a text terminal application, launch the one of your preference.

## Extract the project working directory

Run the following command in the aforementioned terminal application to change the terminal working directory to the directory you wish to host the project working directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/workdir/hosting/dir
```

Then run the following command to extract the working directory:

```bash
tar_opts=(
    --extract
    --file /path/to/ubuntu-mainline-kernel-with-zfs-howto-_X_._Y_._Z_.tar.gz
)
if ! tar "${tar_opts[@]}"; then
    printf 'Extract failed.\n' 1>&2
fi
```

## Change the terminal working directory to the project working directory

You may run the following command to switch the terminal working directory to the project working directory:

```bash
if ! cd ubuntu-mainline-kernel-with-zfs-howto-_X_._Y_._Z_; then
    printf 'Working directory switch failed.\n' 1>&2
fi
```

## Install a mainline kernel

Download the desired kernel package from the [Ubuntu Mainline Kernel PPA Archive Ubuntu https://kernel.ubuntu.com â€º ~kernel-ppa](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/) and install it using the following terminal command as root:

```bash
sudo apt install /path/to/linux-*.deb
```

**WARNING:** Be careful not to accidentally install unrelated kernel packages.  You may check how the `/path/to/linux-*.deb` glob pattern expanded by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
echo /path/to/linux-*.deb
```

You can also use [the Mainline Kernels utility](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline) to install and manage Ubuntu mainline kernels.

This kernel will currently not be able to boot the system as it does not have the required driver to mount the root filesystem on the ZFS storage system.

## Acquire a recent OpenZFS on Linux source archive

You may acquire the source archive and the PGP signature required to verify the archive on the [OpenZFS on Linux](https://zfsonlinux.org/) website:
